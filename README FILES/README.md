# Danko's Web Portfolio ðŸš€

This is my personal web design portfolio, building it from scratch with HTML, CSS, and future JavaScript components.

The visual style is inspired by sci-fi aesthetics like Starfield, Star Trek, and NASA-punk.  
Iâ€™ll document my full design process (Figma â†’ Code â†’ Deployment) and use this as a case study for potential employers.
